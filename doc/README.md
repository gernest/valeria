# Introduction
wuxia is a prtable static web solution. Wuxia allows you to create, build and
deploy static websites.

Wuxia is made up of components that when combined together forms a powerful
solution for the static web fans. It ships with a static site generator, static
site server, a `git push` based static site builder and a multi domain static
site host all in a single binary.

I built this for personal use, but if you find it useful please do the
followwing, [star the project]() , [fork the project](), [follow the author]()
and in case you encounter any bugs then [open an issue]().
